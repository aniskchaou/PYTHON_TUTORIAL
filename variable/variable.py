#Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.

#The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the 
#variable and the operand to the right of the = operator is
#the value stored in the variable. For example −

#!/usr/bin/python

counter = 100          # An integer assignment
miles   = 1000.0       # A floating point
name    = "John"       # A string

print counter
print miles
print name

#output
#100
#1000.0
#John


#Standard Data Types
#The data stored in memory can be of many types. 
#For example, a person's age is stored as a numeric value and his 
#or her address is stored as alphanumeric characters. Python has 
#various standard data types that are used to define the operations
#possible on them and the storage method for each of them.

#Python has five standard data types −

#    Numbers
#    String
#    List
#    Tuple
#    Dictionary


#Data Type Conversion

	

#int(x [,base]) Converts x to an integer. base specifies the base if x is a string.
	

#long(x [,base] ) Converts x to a long integer. base specifies the base if x is a string.
 	

#float(x) Converts x to a floating-point number.


#complex(real [,imag]) Creates a complex number.
 	

#str(x) Converts object x to a string representation.


#repr(x) Converts object x to an expression string.
 	

#eval(str) Evaluates a string and returns an object.
 	

#tuple(s) Converts s to a tuple.
 	

#list(s) Converts s to a list. 	

#set(s) Converts s to a set.
	

#dict(d) Creates a dictionary. d must be a sequence of (key,value) tuples.
	
#frozenset(s) Converts s to a frozen set.
	

#chr(x) Converts an integer to a character.
 	

#unichr(x) Converts an integer to a Unicode character.
	

#ord(x) Converts a single character to its integer value.
 	

#hex(x) Converts an integer to a hexadecimal string.
 	

#oct(x) Converts an integer to an octal string.
